Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery, also known as CI/CD, is a set of processes that helps in faster integration of software code changes and deployment to the end user in a reliable manner. The more frequent integrations and deployments helps reduce the software development lifecycle. 
There are three practices in CI/CD:

* Continuous Integration
* Continuous Delivery
* Continuous Deployment
Letâ€™s look in detail at each of these in the coming sections.

## The Benefits of CI/CD

1.	Significant reduction in integration problems.
2.	Teams can develop cohesive software more rapidly.
3.	Improved Collaboration between developers and operation teams can reduce the production integration issues.
4.	Faster delivery of new features with less friction
5.	Better debugging the production issues and fixing them in the next release/patch.
