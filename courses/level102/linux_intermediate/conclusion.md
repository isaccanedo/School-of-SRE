# Conclusion

Understanding package management is very crucial as an SRE, we always want the right set of software with their compatible versions to work in harmony to drive the big infrastructure and organization. 

We also saw how we can configure and use storage drives and how we can have redundancy of data using RAID to avoid the data loss, how data is placed over disk and use of file systems.

Archiving and Backup is also a crucial part of being an SRE, It’s our responsibility to keep the data safe and in a more efficient manner. 

Bash is very useful to automate the day to day toil that an SRE stumbles into. The above walkthrough of bash gives us an idea to get started, but mere reading through it won’t take you much further. I believe “taking action and practicing the topic” would give you confidence and will help you become a better SRE.
