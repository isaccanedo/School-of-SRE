# Conclusion

In this sub-module we have toured the world of containers starting from why we use containers, how containers evolved from the virtual machine past (though they are, in no means, obsolete) and how they are different from virtual machines. We then saw how containers are implemented with emphasis on cgroups and namespaces along with some hands-on exercises. Finally we concluded our journey with container orchestration where we learnt a bit of Kubernetes with some practical examples.

Hope this module gives you enough knowledge and interest to continue learning and applying these technologies in greater depth!
